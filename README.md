# MTA Subway Realtime Visualization

The application will pull real time data from NYC's MTA subway system. A user 
will be able to first select a subway line. Selecting a station from that
line will render information about incoming trains and how many minutes away they
are estimated to be. Congestion data for the closest train car will also be
shown visually as the train interface will show more people inside.

## Functionality & MVPs

In MTA Subway Realtime Visualization, users will be able to:

- Easily choose to view each subway line with an interactive sidebar
- Seamlessly select a train station from a visual representation of the subway line
- View time arrival information about incoming trains for that particular station
- View expected congestion/crowdedness of the closest incoming train by seeing a
correspondinfly populated train car

In addition, this project will include:
- Instructions on how to use the train car interface
- a README document with more in depth details about the project
